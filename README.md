ART BY TORIA 

The art by toria website is designed for a local artist. the use of this website 
will be to allow the artist to display her work (portfolio page) and to allow 
members of the public to make contact with the artist to display interest in 
having a piece of work done for them. 

UX

the intial website plan can be found in my github which in linked HERE. the plans
were drawn up by me the website designer and agreed by the artist. The artist 
liked how she could display all her work in one simple slideshow and how is it is
for website viewers to contact her about more work. This will help to achieve the 
main goal of starting up her business which is to get loads of publicty through 
plenty of online viewing options i.e social media and websites. 

EXSISTING FEATURES. 

1. MENU BAR. (this menu bar will allow the users to navigate simply and easily around the website)
2. Social media link (the links will allow viewers to find the artist on all of her social media platforms.)
3. Background image (the background image is used to display the artist main picture and logo on a mass scale; allowing the users to see not only how talented the artist is but to also see a familar sight if they already know of the artist)
4. Text Logo (the text logo is used on the main page to allow the user to know who this website belongs to.)
5. An image of the artist (this image is used to display who the artist is)
6. About the artist description (this description is used to let the user get to know the artist that they will be buying from and maybe 
   connect with the user on a personal level)
7. Slideshow (the slideshow is used to display all of the artists work. This will be updated every time the artist completes a new piece of work)
8. Contact form (the contact form is used for the users to be able to contact the artist about work they would like done or any other enquires 
   they have)

WEBSITE TESTING 

The website has been completly tested by myself and family members. This has involved loading up the website on different platforms, testing
all the links on the website including the social media and website navigation and using the contact form to send a email to the artist's 
email address and also testing it to see the error message when infomation is not submitted. 


CREDITS 

The images used on this website have been sent by ArtByToria. The images are of her art work. 

The majority of inspiration for this website was gained from various youtube videos. Using numerous videos I, the creator, managed to gain an understanding of 
what I wanted to deliver for this website and the artist. All images are owned by the artist and all the infomation and text have been created 
between myself and the artist.c
My other inspiration has come from studying a course through the Code Insitiute. 
The only code partly borrowed and edited on this website to personalisd it is the portfolio page code from  line 27 to line 111. This is used
to help create the artist portfolio so that she can display all of her artwork easily.
