ART BY TORIA 

The art by toria website is designed for a local artist. the use of this website 
will be to allow the artist to display her work (portfolio page) and to allow 
members of the public to make contact with the artist to display intrest in 
having a piece of work done for them. 

UX

the intial website plan can be found in my github which in linked HERE. the plans
were drawn up by me the website designer and agreed by the artist. the artist 
liked how she could display all her work in one simple slideshow and how is it is
for webstie viewers to contact her about more work. this will help to achieve the 
main goal of starting up her business which is to get loads of publicty through 
plenty of online viewing options i.e social media and websites. 

EXSISTING FEATURES. 

1. MENU BAR. (this menu bar will allow are users to navigate simply and easily around the website)
